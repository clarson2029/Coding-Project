        <h1>Effort and Outcomes: How Student Choices Shape Academic Performance</h1>
        <p>This section focuses on how students’ own behaviors and decisions influence their academic results. The parallel 
            coordinates graph highlights the relationship between hours studied, class attendance, and exam scores, 
            illustrating how consistent effort and engagement tend to align with higher performance. Complementing this, 
            the bar graph comparing average exam scores across different numbers of tutoring sessions shows how additional 
            academic support can further impact outcomes. Together, these visualizations emphasize that while external factors 
            matter, students’ personal investment—through studying, attendance, and seeking help—plays a central role in shaping 
            their grades.</p>

        <h2>Patterns of Effort and Performance</h2>
        <p>This parallel coordinates graph visualizes the relationship between students’ study habits, attendance, and exam 
            performance. By displaying hours studied, attendance levels, and exam scores along connected axes, the graph reveals 
            common patterns in how individual behaviors align with academic outcomes. Students who study more consistently and 
            attend class more regularly tend to trace paths toward higher exam scores, highlighting the interconnected role of 
            effort and engagement in academic success.</p>

                        <p>By clicking and dragging on the Hours_Studied axis from 35 to 44, we can get a sense of
                        the effects of studying a lot. Observe that, even though they spend so much time studying,
                        their attendance rates are spread out, some lower than 65% attendance. Yet, they all score
                        on the upper end of the exam, averaging somewhere between 70 and 75.</p>

                        <h5>The Effect of Attendance</h5>
                        <p>By highlighting the students attending class from 95% to 100% of the time, we see the overwhelming
                        affect of attendance. Even more so than the group at the top of the studying hours, these students 
                        achieve the higher grades. This suggests that attendance is, likely, the single largest indicator
                        of how well as student is doing in a class.</p>

                        <p>We can most easily see who scores high on their exams by studying who does poorly. In highlighting
                        the bottom of the exam scores (from 55 to 60), we see that the students who do the worst both attend
                        class the least and study the least. Interestingly, the students who did well on the exam (90 and above)
                        are spread out, with one student studying only 1 hour.</p>

        <h2>The Impact of Tutoring on Exam Performance</h2>
        <p>This bar graph compares the average exam scores of students across different numbers of tutoring sessions. 
            By grouping students based on how frequently they receive tutoring, the visualization illustrates how 
            additional academic support is associated with differences in performance. The trend suggests that 
            students who participate in more tutoring sessions tend to achieve higher average exam scores, 
            emphasizing the role of targeted assistance and proactive help-seeking in improving academic outcomes.</p>

                        <h5>Tutoring Directly Effects Scores</h5>
                        <p>In this graph, we quickly see the effects of tutoring on exams scores. It only takes two tutoring
                        sessions to pass the average score on the exam. Those who take just four more tutoring sessions (for a
                        total of 6) perform significantly better, scoring 4.4% better than the average.</p>

                        <h5>Who gets tutored?</h5>
                        <p>The effecitveness of tutoring sessions calls into question just who can access these tutoring
                        sessions. Unfortunately, tutoring sessions cost money, which might help to explain why families
                        with higher levels of education (and thus income) typically <a href="parents.html">score higher.</a></p>

                        <h5>Statistical Significance</h5>
                        <p>This difference between the mean and students that take six tutoring sessions represents the
                        greatest discrepancy of any data point in the dataset. In terms of <a href="data.html">statistical signifiance,</a>
                        this difference represents a interval of confidence well beyond 99.99%. This proves the importance of the
                        difference between the students who took six tutoring sessions versus the average: there is avery small percent chance
                        that six tutoring sessions affected them in no way (in fact a <0.01% chance) and they scored so well out of pure luck.</p>
