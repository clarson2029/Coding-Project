        <h1>Home Matters: How Family Background Shapes Student Success</h1>
        <p>This page explores the powerful ways in which a student’s home environment influences their academic experience. 
        By examining exam scores across varying levels of parental involvement and parental education, we highlight how support 
        and educational background at home can shape academic outcomes. We also consider how physical distance from home affects 
        students’ day-to-day engagement, showing that students who live farther away tend to attend class less consistently. Together, 
        these visualizations connect family influence and accessibility to school with both performance and participation, offering a 
        more complete picture of how factors beyond the classroom contribute to student success.</p>

        <h2>Distance from Home, Distance from Class</h2>
        <p>This graph focuses specifically on the relationship between how far students live from home and how regularly they attend 
        class. By comparing average attendance levels across increasing distances, the visualization illustrates a clear pattern: as 
        distance from home increases, consistent class attendance tends to decline. This suggests that logistical challenges—such as 
        longer commutes, transportation limitations, or reduced daily support—may create barriers to regular attendance. Highlighting 
        this relationship emphasizes that academic engagement is influenced not only by motivation or ability, but also by the 
        practical realities of students’ home circumstances.</p>

                        and thus feel more responsible to keep in touch with their family, attend class less often.

        <h2>Support at Home, Success at School</h2>
        <p>This graph examines how students’ academic performance varies with levels of parental involvement and parental education. 
            By comparing average exam scores across these categories, the visualization highlights a clear association between 
            stronger support systems at home and higher academic achievement. Students with more involved parents or with parents 
            who have higher levels of education tend to perform better on exams, suggesting that guidance, expectations, and access 
            to educational resources at home play an important role in shaping outcomes. Together, these measures underscore how 
            family engagement and educational background can meaningfully influence student success in the classroom.</p>

                        <p>Comparing across each overall group, parental education level significantly increases 
                        the scores that students from that group achieve on the exam, but less so than parental
                        involvement differences within each group. Check <a href="data.html">here</a> for an explanation

                        impacts students' exam scores. Within each subgroup (each level of parental education), the level
                        of parental involvement causes a stair-like ascendance from low to high levels of parental involvement,
                        which positively impacts exam scores.</p>

                        <h5>Outliers</h5>
                        <p>Within the parental education groups, there are more outliers (dots above the box plots) for 
                        groups with lesser parental education. This reveals the stereotypical will to simply 'work harder' 
                        for students that might be more disadvantaged. In fact, the individual who scored the highest on this
                        exam (exam_score = 101) was a part of the most disadvantaged group (parental level of high school, low 
                        parental motivation), which proves that the general trends we associate with the group aren't entirely
                        true just for the individual.</p>
